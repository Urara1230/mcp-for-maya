description: "Run and act on the mcp-for-maya scene_review audit: pick the right checks, interpret the 0-100 score and per-check results, register studio validators into the review, and map common findings (orphans, naming violations, overlaps, weak aesthetics, lighting gaps) to concrete fixes. Use after structural scene changes, before reporting a scene as done, or when a scene feels disorganized."

# scene_review Playbook

> **Experimental.** Evaluated on Claude Code only; untested on Codex/Gemini CLI/Cursor. Tracked in issue #3.

`scene_review()` runs up to 11 deterministic checks and returns `{checks, issues, score, total_issues, errors, warnings, standards}` — score is 0-100 (weighted per-check, normalized). Studio validators registered in the session add a `custom` section with its own score.

## Checks

| check | what it looks at |
|---|---|
| spatial | object/camera/light presence vs expectations |
| overlaps | bbox collisions (parent-child excluded) |
| conflicts | penetration between unrelated objects |
| zones | zone coverage vs naming-rule zones |
| naming | GRP_/GEO_/MAT_/CAM_/LGT_/LOC_ prefix discipline |
| components | GRP_ grouping, nesting depth ≤ 4 |
| orphans | empty groups, default Maya names |
| aesthetics | 5-dimension aesthetic score (color/composition/scale/lighting/flow) |
| lighting | three-point setup, fill ratio, decay |
| organization | overall hierarchy health |
| constraints | the built-in 500-object budget (not the `custom` section below) |

Per-check weights are defined in the review engine — see the audit table in README.md for exact max points; this card intentionally does not duplicate them.

## How to run

- Full audit: `scene_review()` — after structural changes.
- Subset: `scene_review(checks="overlaps,conflicts")` — one comma-separated string; cheaper re-verify after a targeted fix. The tool splits it itself, so a Python list is not the shape it accepts.
- Maya-side, for the same subset: `_mcp_scene.scene_review(["overlaps","conflicts"])` — a Python list, reached through `execute_code` once `_mcp_scene` is in the session (see Studio validators below). That is the Maya-side call, not the MCP argument.
- Interpret: each entry in `issues[]` carries `severity` (error > warning > info), `check`, and a `msg` summary (counts + advice). An `info` row lands in neither the `errors` nor the `warnings` count. Per-object detail lives under `checks[]` — e.g. `checks.overlaps.details` names the colliding pairs (sampled list). Fix errors first; warnings are judgment calls.

## Findings → actions

- `orphans`: root-level meshes or empty groups → reparent under a `GRP_*` group; delete empty groups.
- `naming`: rename to the prefix convention; never ship `pCube1`-style names.
- `overlaps` / `conflicts`: `scene_measure(obj_a, obj_b, mode="clearance")`, then move or resize; re-run those checks.
- `zones` low coverage: `scene_plan` for zone mapping and auto-grouping suggestions.
- `aesthetics` / `lighting` weak: `scene_aesthetics()` for the 5-dimension breakdown; lighting fixes follow three-point discipline (key/fill/rim).
- `constraints` violations: read the rule type in the issue, then satisfy it or re-validate via `scene_validate`.

## Studio validators

Register rules in the Maya session via `execute_code` and `scene_review()` reports them in a separate `custom` section — `validators` (each with `name`, `family`, `severity`, `weight`, `passed`, `status` — `passed` | `failed` | `check_error` — and `message`), `score`/`max_score` in weight points from one denominator, and `issues` (each with `severity`, `check: "custom"`, `name`, `family`, `msg`) for whatever did not pass. The built-in 0-100 never moves and the section is absent when nothing is registered. Nothing in `custom` reaches the top-level `errors`/`warnings`/`total_issues` counts — those belong to the built-in audit, so the `custom` section has to be read on its own.

`_mcp_scene` is not in a fresh session until a tool that uses it injects it, and `execute_code` never injects anything — it only forwards code to Maya. Run `scene_review()` (or `scene_snapshot()`) once first; the audit before you register is the built-in one.

Pre-import the module in its own `execute_code` call, then send each validator call as one expression with `result_type="JSON"` — `execute_code` defaults to `result_type="NONE"`, which runs statements and hands back `None`, so with the default there is no return to read. `import _mcp_scene; _mcp_scene.register_validator(...)` in one payload is the shape that fails under result capture. JSON capture may hand you the decoded dict or its JSON text; handle both.

```python
# 0) scene_review() or scene_snapshot() first: that is what puts _mcp_scene in the session
# execute_code 1: import _mcp_scene
# execute_code 2+, one expression per call, result_type="JSON":
_mcp_scene.register_validator(
    "roots_named",
    lambda: (False, "3 root objects are unnamed"),  # or just True/False
    severity="warning",  # "error" | "warning" | "info" — the built-in vocabulary
    weight=2,
    family="studio",  # free label on the result — you group by it, the report does not
)
_mcp_scene.list_validators()
_mcp_scene.unregister_validator("roots_named")
```

What each call hands back:

- `register_validator(name, predicate, severity="error", weight=1, family="custom", message=None)` → `{"registered": name, "overwritten": bool, "count": int}`. Same name overwrites, so `overwritten: true` is the expected answer on a re-register, not a second copy of the rule. `message=` is the rule's own report text, used when the predicate hands back no text of its own — a bare `True`/`False` or a `(passed, None)` — on a pass as on a failure; a `(bool, message)` return wins over it, and a `check_error` row carries the failure's own text rather than this. With neither source of text, the row reads `<name> passed` / `<name> failed`.
- `list_validators()` → `{"count": int, "validators": [{"name": ..., "family": ..., "severity": ..., "weight": ..., "message": ...}]}`, in run order. It is how you read the active names, and it never echoes the predicate — that is a live callable and would not survive the JSON trip back to the host.
- `unregister_validator(name)` → `{"unregistered": name, "count": int}`. A name that is not registered comes back as the error envelope with `validator_not_found`; it is not a silent no-op.

A bad argument is refused with an envelope rather than an exception: `{"error": {"code": ..., "message": ...}}`, plus a `suggestion` where there is one. The checks are `invalid_validator_name` (both calls refuse a bad name), `invalid_predicate`, `invalid_severity`, `invalid_weight`, `invalid_family`, `invalid_message`; sizing the registry is the `weight_overflow` refusal below. Nothing runs at registration time, so a bad predicate is only discovered when the review runs — and is then isolated the same way as one that raises. One limit, same shape as the isolation's below: the envelope covers values the API can read, and a caller-defined subclass that raises from its own hook runs outside those checks and escapes as an exception — e.g. `strip()` on `name` or `family`, the `__eq__` the severity test asks for, or a `__float__` on `weight` that raises anything other than `TypeError`/`ValueError`/`OverflowError`.

A predicate returns `bool` or `(bool, message)` — the pair accepted as a tuple or as the same two items in a list; anything else is recorded as `check_error` rather than guessed at. A predicate that raises is isolated the same way — and `check_error` counts as failed, so it costs its weight and lands in `issues` like any other violation while the rest of the review runs. One limit, stated plainly: the isolation catches `Exception`, so a `BaseException` such as `KeyboardInterrupt` still stops the run — that is a human stopping Maya, not a rule misbehaving. Weights must be finite positive numbers of the same order of magnitude (1-100 is the design range, not an enforced cap): a string, a bool, `nan`, `inf`, zero or a negative comes back `invalid_weight`, while a registration that would push the registry total past the float range is refused with `weight_overflow` rather than landing an unparsable score. Re-registering after a reconnect is safe, and it is required: replacing the module or restarting Maya clears the registry, so a `custom` section that vanished means re-register, not "passed". Pre-1.0 API: it may break before 1.0, with a changelog note.

## Done means

- errors: 0; warnings reviewed (not necessarily zero — judgment).
- with validators registered, `custom` is part of done too: a failing row or a `check_error` there is not covered by `errors: 0`.
- after fixes, re-run the affected checks; never re-report a stale score.
